## General Information
-Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
-Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). 
-Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.
-In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters’.
-Aim of this case study is Identify the risky loan applicants using Exploratory Data Analysis, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.
-Lending Club wants to understand the driving factors behind loan default and identify the variables which are strong indicators of default.

#Observations

    The interest rate for charged off loans is higher , compared to that of fully paid loans in all the groups. This is a driving factor for loan defaulting.
    The Loan is higher for all the income groups ,people who defaulted.
    The number of loans defaulted are the highest in the loan pupose"debt_consolation",But  the annual income is not the highest.
    The loan was sanctioned/issued in December are maximum defaulted and  Loans issued in the year 2011 are also higher comparing other years
    Employees with highest tenure in an organization got higher Loan amount.
#Recommendations

    Modest interest for all types of loan would help in minimizing load default rate 
    Higher income group and lower income group , moderate loan amount would help in reducing defaulters 
    The number of loans defaulted are the highest in the loan pupose"debt_consolation", number of loans, loan amount can be reduced
    December month loans seems seasonal with high default rate, thus can pushed to a month before or later , gives time to employees think and apply for loans
    Employees with highest tenure  likely to repay the loan successfully
